Hey there,  
I’m Kevin a web developer from Bremen, Germany. I have built websites ranging from small, through shop systems, to larger applications. My framework of choice is WordPress with which I’m building custom tailored solutions. Besides being a front and back end developer I’m also passionate about website architecture and UX. Challenging projects motivate me to keep up to date with the latest technologies as well as workflows and project management techniques to optimize productivity.
