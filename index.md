Hey there,  
Iâ€™m Kevin a web developer from Germany. My framework of choice is WordPress with which I am building custom tailored solutions. Some of my work at various agencies include a web shop for insurance products with a complex premium calculation that is build on top of WooCommerce, a plugin to manage franchisees dynamically generated landing pages and an online video archive with a YouTube integration for a national broadcaster.  
When not doing back end development I like programming component-based client-side applications using Preact and the WordPress REST API.
